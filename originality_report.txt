Originality Status: Potentially Novel

Dependencies:
* AI model for content analysis (e.g., BERT, GPT)
* zk-SNARK or zk-STARK library (e.g., libsnark, arkworks)
* Blockchain platform (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon)
* Cryptographic primitives (hash functions, elliptic curve cryptography)

Plagiarism Likelihood Estimate: Low.  While the individual components (AI, zk-proofs, blockchain) are established technologies, their specific combination for originality checking appears to be unexplored, based on my research.  However, the novelty would depend heavily on the specific implementation and the unique aspects of the AI model and zk-proof protocol used.
